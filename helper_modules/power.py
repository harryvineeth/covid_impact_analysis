Overall, total energy generation remained slightly lower than that of 2019.  There was a distinct decrease between March-May 2020, corresponding to the initial spread of COVID-19 in the US. After this minimum value, the plot generally trends upwards, indicating a gradual recovery. This may also indicate that electricity requirements are gradually increasing from year to year.")
    col.markdown("The main driver of monthly variation appears to be seasonal trends, with spikes during winter and summer months. However, COVID-19 cases do appear to be playing a role as the rate of power generation increases during the period of the largest wave of COVID cases during the winter of 2020 and the Delta variant outbreak in the summer of 2021. This may be due to an increase in residential power consumption for climate control, without a corresponding decrease in workplace power consumption as their climate control needs do not change. The monthly fluctuations remain relatively small, as national energy requirements should not change drastically and stay at home policies would only shift energy demand from commercial to residential.")

Therefore, a stay at home policy would impact Rhode Island more heavily than other states.")

Overall, individual state analysis of electricity generation heavily depends on energy profiles and national trends should be not applied without further analysis.")
